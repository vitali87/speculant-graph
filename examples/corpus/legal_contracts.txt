What is a force majeure clause? A force majeure clause is a contractual provision that excuses one or both parties from performance of the contract in some way following the occurrence of certain events beyond the parties' control. Force majeure literally means "superior force" in French.

A typical force majeure clause might read: "Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performing its obligations where such failure or delay results from any cause that is beyond the reasonable control of that party."

Force majeure events typically include acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, labor strikes, and governmental actions. The specific events covered by a force majeure clause should be clearly defined in the contract.

What are indemnification clauses? An indemnification clause requires one party to compensate the other party for certain costs and expenses, typically those arising from third-party claims. Indemnification provisions are common in many types of commercial contracts.

What are liquidated damages? A liquidated damages clause specifies a predetermined amount of damages that must be paid if one party breaches the contract. This amount represents a reasonable estimate of the actual damages that would result from the breach.

Confidentiality clauses, also known as non-disclosure agreements, protect sensitive information shared between parties. These clauses prevent the receiving party from disclosing confidential information to third parties without authorization.

A termination clause outlines the circumstances under which a contract can be ended before its natural expiration date. Common grounds for termination include material breach, bankruptcy, or mutual agreement of the parties.

Choice of law clauses determine which jurisdiction's laws will govern the interpretation and enforcement of the contract. These clauses are particularly important in contracts involving parties from different states or countries.

Arbitration clauses require parties to resolve disputes through arbitration rather than litigation. Arbitration is often faster and less expensive than traditional court proceedings.

A severability clause provides that if any provision of the contract is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable.

Warranties are statements of fact or promises made by one party to another. A breach of warranty occurs when these statements prove to be false or the promises are not kept.

The statute of limitations sets the maximum time period within which a party must file a lawsuit. After this period expires, the right to sue is typically lost.

Consideration is something of value exchanged between parties that is necessary to form a legally binding contract. Without consideration, an agreement may not be enforceable.
